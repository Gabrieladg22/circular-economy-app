# Circular Economy App ♻️

A full-stack application that promotes sustainability by helping businesses donate or trade surplus materials instead of discarding them. The app tracks CO₂ savings (in kg) by reusing items rather than producing new ones, reducing landfill waste and emissions.

- Business registration
- Browse, add, edit, or delete materials (admin only)
- Request and manage trades between users
- Real-time calculation of environmental savings

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js
- **API:** Custom carbon savings calculation

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was created as a capstone for a coding bootcamp and combines my background in environmental engineering with my new skills in software development.
